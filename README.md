**[中文介绍](README_zh.md)** ｜ **[2019 scientific and free compound password management - sspai (In Chinese)](https://sspai.com/post/55403)**

SeekPassword is a software inspired by FlowerPassword https://wsine.github.io/seekpassword/ . This project is a Windows client based on this webpage, using HTML Compiler.

SeekPassword is a password calculator that uses a root password (which can be easily remembered) and a distinguishing code (which can be distinguished by application) to calculate an irreversible password.  At the same time, it solves the problem of high risk of the same password on multiple platforms and the difficulty of memorizing pure random passwords.  For specific recommended password management strategies, please refer to the [author's article (In Chinese)] above (https://sspai.com/post/55403).
